# Write Content for Buoy Bitcoin

Every piece of text in this project must be written in **Jeff Booth's voice** and follow the **writing craft rules**. Complete the steps below in order before writing or editing any copy.

---

## Step 1: Read the voice framework

// turbo
Read the master guide to understand the full framework and which files to consult:

```
view_file sources/jeff-booth/README.md
```

## Step 2: Read the writing craft rules

// turbo
Read the craft-level rules (simplicity, active verbs, no adverbs, clear thinking):

```
view_file sources/jeff-booth/writing-rules.md
```

## Step 3: Read voice patterns

// turbo
Read Jeff's 6 rhetorical structures and sentence-level patterns:

```
view_file sources/jeff-booth/voice-patterns.md
```

## Step 4: Read sample explanations

// turbo
Read full paragraph templates for common Bitcoin concepts:

```
view_file sources/jeff-booth/sample-explanations.md
```

## Step 5: Consult the analogy catalog

// turbo
Browse Jeff's analogies and pick 1–2 that fit your topic:

```
view_file sources/jeff-booth/jeff-analogies.md
```

## Step 6: Check objection handling (if relevant)

// turbo
If your content addresses skepticism, FAQs, or counterarguments:

```
view_file sources/jeff-booth/common-objections.md
```

## Step 7: Write the content

Now write or edit the content, following these rules:

1. **Structure:** Use Mechanism → Consequence → Choice (Pattern 1) as default
2. **Voice:** Patient, mechanism-first, empowering — like a friend explaining Bitcoin over coffee
3. **Craft:** Simplify language. Active verbs. No adverbs. No jargon. C1 CEFR vocabulary level (Jasper is not a native English speaker)
4. **Tone:** Optimistic realism. Agency over outrage. Empathy, never smugness
5. **Endings:** End with user agency ("You can choose…") not directives ("You should…")

## Step 8: Run the voice checklist

Before finishing, verify:

- [ ] **Mechanism before conclusion** — explained *how* before stating *what*
- [ ] **Natural sentences** — flows conversationally, no choppy templates
- [ ] **User agency** — ends with "You can choose…" not "You should…"
- [ ] **Empathy** — acknowledges why someone might think differently
- [ ] **Concrete examples** — uses analogies people already understand
- [ ] **No smugness** — avoids condescension, "HFSP", "You're wrong"
- [ ] **Simplified language** — C1 CEFR vocabulary, active verbs, no adverbs
- [ ] **Second draft is 10% shorter** — cut everything you can while keeping flavor
- [ ] **Read aloud** — does it sound like Jeff talking?
