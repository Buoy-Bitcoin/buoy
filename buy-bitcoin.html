          <p>Most exchanges work like this: you send money, they show you a balance on a screen. But that balance is not
            bitcoin. It is a number in their database. They hold the private keys, which means they control your access.
            They can freeze your account, limit withdrawals, or lend your coins to someone else behind the scenes. Every
            service on this page is Bitcoin-only, but they differ in one important way: who holds the keys after you
            buy.</p>
          <p>Non-custodial services send bitcoin straight to your own wallet. You give them an address, they send sats.
            No balance on their servers, no trust needed after the transaction settles. Custodial exchanges hold your
            bitcoin until you withdraw it. Until you move it off the platform, you own a promise, not bitcoin. That
            difference matters more than most people realize.</p>
          <p>The other big factor is identity verification. KYC (Know Your Customer) exchanges require government ID
            before you can buy. Peer-to-peer platforms let you trade with other people, often with little or no identity
            requirements. KYC exchanges tend to have better prices and faster execution. But every piece of data you
            hand over becomes a permanent record tied to your bitcoin activity. There is no undoing that.</p>
          <p>You can compare the services below on what matters most: fees, custody model, DCA support, Lightning
            withdrawal, and geographic availability. Select any two and tap <em>Compare</em> to see them side-by-side.
            If you are new to Bitcoin, start with <a href="what-is-bitcoin.html">what Bitcoin actually is</a>
            before choosing where to buy.</p>

                <summary>What is the cheapest way to buy bitcoin?</summary>
                <div>
                  <p>Fees depend on the service and how you pay. Bank transfers are almost always cheaper than card
                    payments because cards carry processor fees that get passed to you. Among KYC exchanges, <a
                      href="/services/strike.html">Strike</a> and <a href="/services/river.html">River</a> charge some
                    of the lowest fees, often under 1%. On no-KYC peer-to-peer platforms like <a
                      href="/services/bisq.html">Bisq</a>, maker fees are low but sellers set their own prices, which
                    usually include a premium above market rate. The cheapest option depends on your country, payment
                    method, and whether you are willing to provide identity documents. You can compare fees across
                    services using the tool above.</p>

              </details>
              <details>
                <summary>Can I buy bitcoin without providing my identity?</summary>
                <div>
                  <p>Yes. Peer-to-peer platforms like <a href="/services/bisq.html">Bisq</a>, <a
                      href="/services/hodlhodl.html">HodlHodl</a>, <a href="/services/peach.html">Peach</a>, and <a
                      href="/services/robosats.html">RoboSats</a> let you trade with other people without KYC
                    verification. You negotiate with them instead of going through a company. Liquidity tends to be
                    lower and you will usually pay a premium above the spot price. But the bitcoin you receive is not
                    tied to your identity in a corporate database. In a system where data is permanent, that privacy has
                    real value.</p>
                </div>
              </details>

                <summary>What is dollar-cost averaging and which services support it?</summary>
                <div>
                  <p>Dollar-cost averaging means buying a fixed amount of bitcoin on a regular schedule, whether weekly,
                    biweekly, or monthly, regardless of the price. It removes the emotional cycle of trying to time the
                    market, watching the price run, then buying the top out of panic. Over time, your purchases average
                    out across highs and lows. Services like <a href="/services/river.html">River</a>, <a
                      href="/services/swan.html">Swan</a>, <a href="/services/relai.html">Relai</a>, and <a
                      href="/services/bull-bitcoin.html">Bull Bitcoin</a> all support automatic DCA. The important next
                    step is setting up auto-withdrawal to your own wallet. DCA builds the habit. Self-custody is what
                    makes it sovereign.</p>
                </div>
              </details>
              <details>
                <summary>What's the difference between custodial and non-custodial?</summary>
                <div>
                  <p>A custodial exchange holds your bitcoin on their servers. You see a balance on a screen, but they
                    control the private keys. That means they decide whether you can withdraw, when, and how much. A
                    non-custodial service sends bitcoin to your wallet after purchase. You hold the keys from the start,
                    which means no one else can freeze, seize, or lend out your coins. Every exchange failure in
                    Bitcoin's history, from Mt. Gox to FTX to Celsius, happened to people who thought they owned bitcoin
                    but actually owned promises. Self-custody removes that risk entirely.</p>
                </div>
              </details>
              <details>
                <summary>Which exchanges send bitcoin directly to my wallet?</summary>
                <div>
                  <p><a href="/services/bull-bitcoin.html">Bull Bitcoin</a>, <a href="/services/relai.html">Relai</a>,
                    and <a href="/services/pocket.html">Pocket</a> are non-custodial. They require your wallet address
                    and send bitcoin straight to it. Peer-to-peer platforms also settle to your address. If you use a
                    custodial exchange, you can still move to self-custody by withdrawing after each purchase. The point
                    is not to leave bitcoin on someone else's platform longer than necessary. Once it is in <a
                      href="store-it-safely.html">your own wallet</a>, it is yours. No counterparty risk, no
                    promises.</p>
                </div>
              </details>
              <details>
                <summary>Should I buy bitcoin now?</summary>
                <div>
                  <p>Buoy is a comparison tool, not a financial advisor. But here is a way to think about it: most
                    people who try to pick the right moment end up watching from the sidelines. Dollar-cost averaging
                    exists for this reason. It removes the timing question entirely. You commit to a regular amount and
                    let time do the work. Whether that is the right choice for you depends on your situation, but the
                    mechanism itself is designed to take the anxiety out of "when." You can explore services that
                    support
                    DCA using the compare tool above.</p>
