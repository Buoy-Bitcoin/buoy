Strike is the stronger choice for most users. It operates in 95 countries, treats Bitcoin as money you can earn, spend, and save, not just an asset to accumulate, and builds on the payment layers (like Lightning) that Bitcoin needs to avoid the same fate as gold. Swan is US-only but offers a genuinely sovereignty-first custody model with its "zero sats under custody" philosophy and collaborative multi-sig vault. If you're a US-based investor focused on long-term accumulation and self-custody tooling, Swan serves that well. But if you believe Bitcoin has to function as money and not just as a store of value, Strike is building closer to that future.

## Beyond the Features

Most Bitcoin-only companies agree on the diagnosis. Where Strike and Swan split is on a question that the broader Bitcoin community still fights over: should you spend Bitcoin, or should you hold it?

Cory Klippsten has been consistent on this point for years. He subscribes to the staged monetization theory: Bitcoin must first establish itself as a store of value before it can become a medium of exchange. He has stated that it "doesn't make any sense for me to want to spend Bitcoin right now" because he expects it to remain "the fastest horse in the race." When exploring business ideas in 2018, he specifically decided against building a payments company because he believed it was "way too early for venture scale revenue in medium of exchange." Swan reflects this. It is a wealth accumulation platform built around recurring purchases, high-net-worth advisory services, corporate treasury strategies, and inheritance planning. The product assumes you are buying Bitcoin to hold it, possibly for decades.

Jack Mallers sees it differently. He lives entirely on Bitcoin personally, with no fiat holdings. Strike is built around the idea that your paycheck can arrive in Bitcoin, your bills can be paid from your Bitcoin balance, and you can spend depreciating fiat through a credit card while your savings sit in an appreciating asset. Where Swan builds exclusively for the store-of-value phase, Strike builds for the medium-of-exchange phase simultaneously.

This isn't just a strategic disagreement. It's a question about whether Bitcoin survives long-term as an independent monetary network or gets absorbed into the existing financial system the way gold was. Gold worked as a store of value, but because it was impractical for daily transactions, society centralized it into bank vaults. Once centralized, governments issued paper derivatives on top of it, fractionalized the supply, manipulated its price, and eventually abandoned the gold standard altogether. If Bitcoin follows the same path, if holders simply hoard it and measure their wealth by its rising fiat price, the same centralization pressure applies. People will seek convenience and yield by handing their keys to ETFs, custodians, and exchanges. The legacy financial system will wrap Bitcoin in derivatives and control the on-ramps and off-ramps.

The defense against this is a functioning circular economy where people actually earn and spend Bitcoin natively. But that economy depends on infrastructure: payment layers like Lightning, privacy protocols like Fedimint, and the applications built on top of them. Bitcoin's base layer was intentionally designed to prioritize decentralization and security over transaction speed. Its evolution into usable money requires secondary layers to handle the volume and speed of daily commerce without compromising the base layer's integrity. Companies building on those layers are doing the work that keeps Bitcoin independent. Companies building exclusively for accumulation, however well-intentioned, leave that work to others.

This is where the product architectures tell the story. Swan's stated goal is "zero sats under custody," which Klippsten has called "completely counter to the traditional financial AUM model." Swan offers free withdrawals, integrates self-custody education into onboarding, and acquired Specter, an open-source wallet interface for multi-signature setups. They built Swan Vault, a collaborative custody solution where the client holds two of three keys. The architecture is designed so that Swan becomes unnecessary for holding your Bitcoin. From a sovereignty perspective, this is strong.

Strike takes a different approach. It holds your Bitcoin to power financial services around it: lending against your stack, converting your direct deposit, paying your bills. Mallers has called this the "hodler's dream," arguing that Bitcoin-backed loans (with no rehypothecation, held in segregated wallets) let you access your wealth without selling and triggering a taxable event. He has addressed the concern that engaging with fiat financial instruments gives energy to the old system and explicitly disagrees: "I don't think borrowing against your assets is giving energy to the old system. I actually think the opposite." Strike designs itself to be your Bitcoin bank. Swan designs itself to help you leave.

Both models carry risk. Strike's "Bitcoin bank" requires you to trust a custodian, and trusting a custodian is precisely the centralization pressure described above. Mallers promises segregated wallets and no rehypothecation, but the structure still places your Bitcoin in someone else's hands for the duration of a loan or while funds sit in your account. Swan's custody history illustrates the other side of this risk. Swan has cycled through three custodial partners: Prime Trust, which collapsed; Fortress, which was hacked and later acquired by Ripple; and now a combination of Bakkt, BitGo, and Equity Trust. Even a company philosophically committed to getting your Bitcoin off its platform still depends on third-party custody infrastructure during the window between purchase and withdrawal.

Then there is the question of who these services actually serve. Swan is available only in the United States. Strike operates in 95 countries. If Bitcoin is borderless money, a service restricted to one country is building for a specific demographic of that country's investors, not for the global population that needs sound money most. Mallers has spoken about serving users in the Global South, where weak local currencies make Bitcoin savings and payments immediately practical, not a theoretical future phase. Klippsten's focus on high-net-worth families, corporate treasuries, and "Leveraged Bitcoin Equities" reflects a different clientele entirely.

Both founders also engage with Wall Street, though from different angles. Klippsten champions corporate Bitcoin treasury strategies modeled on MicroStrategy and aims to originate "Leveraged Bitcoin Equity" deals through Swan. Mallers launched a separate company, 21, co-founded with Tether and backed by SoftBank, to bring institutional credibility to Bitcoin capital markets. Neither founder is a purist on this front. The distinction is that Mallers pairs institutional engagement with consumer payment infrastructure, while Klippsten pairs it with wealth management and accumulation tools.

Where does that leave the recommendation? Swan's self-custody tooling is genuinely best-in-class for US users who want sovereignty over their holdings. The "zero sats under custody" philosophy, the Vault product, and the Specter acquisition all point in the right direction. But Swan's staged monetization view, its decision not to build payment infrastructure, and its US-only availability limit what it's contributing to Bitcoin's development as functional money. Strike's custodial model introduces real tradeoffs on sovereignty, but its payment infrastructure, its global reach, and its founder's conviction that Bitcoin is money you live on today put it closer to the future where Bitcoin remains independent rather than captured.

## Who Should Use Which?

If you live outside the United States, Strike is your option. Swan is US-only, and Strike operates in 95 countries. For most of the world, geography settles this comparison before philosophy does.
If you're a US-based investor focused on long-term accumulation, self-custody tooling, and wealth planning, Swan is built for you. The "zero sats under custody" goal, Swan Vault's collaborative multi-sig, and services like inheritance planning and tax-loss harvesting cater specifically to holders who want to buy, withdraw, and manage their Bitcoin independently. Swan's 0.99% fee is transparent and competitive for this use case.

If you want to live on Bitcoin, earn your paycheck in it, pay bills from your balance, and borrow against your stack without selling, Strike is the platform built around that workflow. Its tiered fee structure (starting at 0.99% and dropping to 0.39% at higher volumes) rewards active users, and its payment infrastructure treats Bitcoin as money rather than a portfolio line item.
If you're a US user torn between the two, ask yourself which problem you're solving. If you're building a long-term position and want the strongest self-custody path, Swan. If you want Bitcoin to replace your bank account, Strike.
