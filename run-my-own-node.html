          <p>Bitcoin's value comes from rules that no one can change: 21 million cap, predictable issuance, no
            counterfeits, no reversals. But here is the thing. You only know those rules are being followed if you
            verify them yourself. When you use someone else's node to check your balance or broadcast a transaction,
            you are trusting them to tell you the truth. That trust is exactly what Bitcoin was built to eliminate.</p>
          <p>Running your own node means downloading and validating every transaction and block in Bitcoin's history.
            Your hardware checks that no one is lying. Not miners, not exchanges, not governments. If
            someone tried to change the rules, your node would reject it. That is not theoretical. That is the mechanism
            that keeps Bitcoin decentralized: thousands of nodes enforcing identical rules, independently.</p>
          <p>There is a privacy benefit too. When you connect your <a href="store-it-safely.html">wallet</a> to someone
            else's server, they can see your addresses, your balances, and your transaction patterns. Your own node
            keeps that information on your own hardware. Pair it with Tor and you route all of that traffic privately.
            The platforms on this page, <a href="/services/umbrel.html">Umbrel</a>, <a
              href="/services/start9.html">Start9</a>, and <a href="/services/mynode.html">MyNode</a>, turn what used
            to be a command-line project into a plug-and-play setup with app ecosystems.</p>
          <p>Select two platforms below and tap <em>Compare</em> to see how they differ on open-source commitment, Tor
            support, app selection, and hardware flexibility.</p>

                <div>
                  <p>Because trusting someone else's node means trusting someone else to tell you the truth about your
                    money. When you query a third-party server for your balance or broadcast through their
                    infrastructure, they see your addresses, your activity, and they control what you see. Running your
                    own node removes that dependency. You verify every block against Bitcoin's consensus
                    rules. No one can lie to you about the state of the network. A user who verifies is a user who
                    cannot be misled.</p>

                <summary>How much does it cost to run a bitcoin node?</summary>
                <div>
                  <p>The software is free or nearly free. <a href="/services/umbrel.html">Umbrel</a> and <a
                      href="/services/start9.html">Start9</a> are free to install on your own hardware. <a
                      href="/services/mynode.html">MyNode</a> has a free community edition and a paid premium tier. The
                    main cost is the hardware itself. A Raspberry Pi or mini PC runs $100 to $300, plus a 1TB SSD for
                    another $50 to $100. Electricity is a few dollars per month. For less than the cost of a single year
                    of most subscription services, you get independent verification of every bitcoin transaction ever
                    made. That is a remarkable deal.</p>
                </div>

              <details>
                <summary>What hardware do I need to run a bitcoin node?</summary>
                <div>
                  <p>At minimum: a computer with 4GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. The full Bitcoin blockchain is over 500GB and
                    growing. A Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 is one of the most popular choices. Small, affordable, and quiet
                    enough to sit in a closet permanently. Any old laptop, mini PC, or Intel NUC will also work. All
                    three platforms on this page support both Raspberry Pi (ARM) and standard x86 hardware. The initial
                    blockchain sync takes 2 to 7 days depending on your hardware and internet speed, then it runs in the
                    background.</p>

                <div>
                  <p><a href="/services/umbrel.html">Umbrel</a> has the largest app marketplace and the most polished
                    interface. It is the easiest starting point for most people. <a
                      href="/services/start9.html">Start9</a> prioritizes sovereignty and privacy with built-in Tor
                    routing and a fully open-source stack. No phoning home, no telemetry. <a
                      href="/services/mynode.html">MyNode</a> is straightforward and reliable, focused on core Bitcoin
                    and Lightning functionality without frills. The right choice depends on whether you prioritize
                    polish, privacy, or simplicity. You can compare them above to see the trade-offs clearly.</p>

                <summary>Can I run a bitcoin node on a Raspberry Pi?</summary>
                <div>
                  <p>Yes, and it is one of the most common setups in the Bitcoin community. A Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 with
                    4 to 8GB of RAM and an external 1TB SSD is all you need. All three platforms, Umbrel, Start9, and
                    MyNode, provide pre-built images you flash to a microSD card. Plug it in, connect to your network,
                    and you are syncing. The initial sync takes a few days. After that, the node maintains itself and
                    uses minimal bandwidth. Your $150 device verifies every single bitcoin transaction in history.
                    That is the power of keeping the base layer small and accessible.</p>
