          <p>Bitcoin's base layer prioritizes security and decentralization, which means it settles roughly seven
            transactions per second. That is intentional. Keeping the block size small ensures anyone can run a node and
            validate the rules without expensive hardware. But that design choice means paying for a coffee on-chain
            does not make sense when network fees spike. The <a href="what-is-lightning.html">Lightning Network</a>
            solves this by adding a payment layer on top of Bitcoin.</p>
          <p>Protocols scale in layers, not by bloating the base. Lightning handles instant, low-cost payments while
            anchoring back to Layer 1 for final settlement. You can send sats across the world in under a second for
            fractions of a cent, and every channel balance is secured by Bitcoin's proof-of-work. That is not a
            compromise. That is how sound infrastructure works.</p>
          <p>The critical question with any Lightning wallet is the same question that applies everywhere in Bitcoin:
            who holds the keys? Custodial Lightning wallets like <a href="/services/fold.html">Fold</a> are convenient.
            Someone else manages the channels and routing for you. But that convenience comes with the same counterparty
            risk Bitcoin was designed to eliminate. Non-custodial wallets like <a
              href="/services/phoenix.html">Phoenix</a> and <a href="/services/breez.html">Breez</a> let you control
            your own channels. More setup, more responsibility. But your sats stay yours.</p>
          <p>If you are looking for long-term storage rather than spending, check <a
              href="store-it-safely.html">self-custody wallets</a> instead. For everyday payments, select two wallets
            below and tap <em>Compare</em> to see how they differ on custody, fees, backup, and channel management.</p>

                <summary>What is the best bitcoin Lightning wallet?</summary>
                <div>
                  <p>That depends on what you are willing to trade. <a href="/services/phoenix.html">Phoenix</a> is
                    widely considered the best non-custodial option. It manages channels automatically while keeping
                    you in control of the keys. <a href="/services/breez.html">Breez</a> offers similar self-custody
                    with a built-in point-of-sale mode for merchants. <a href="/services/fold.html">Fold</a> is
                    custodial and the easiest to start with, but you are trusting a company with your sats. The right
                    answer depends on whether you prioritize convenience or sovereignty. You can use the compare tool
                    above to see them side-by-side.</p>

                <summary>What's the difference between a custodial and non-custodial Lightning wallet?</summary>
                <div>
                  <p>A custodial Lightning wallet means a company holds your bitcoin and manages payment channels on
                    your behalf. You see a balance. They hold the keys. That is convenient until the company goes under,
                    gets hacked, or freezes your account. A non-custodial Lightning wallet means you control the private
                    keys. Only you can spend your funds. If the wallet company disappears tomorrow, you can still
                    recover your bitcoin from your backup. The entire point of Bitcoin is removing the need to trust
                    intermediaries. Custodial Lightning reintroduces exactly that trust.</p>

              <details>
                <summary>How do Lightning fees compare to on-chain fees?</summary>
                <div>
                  <p>Lightning fees are orders of magnitude lower. A typical Lightning payment costs a fraction of a
                    cent in routing fees, while an on-chain bitcoin transaction can cost anywhere from a few cents to
                    over ten dollars when the network is busy. That difference is what makes Lightning practical for
                    everyday spending: buying coffee, paying invoices, sending small amounts. On-chain fees are the
                    cost of final settlement security. Lightning fees are the cost of speed. Both serve their purpose.

                <summary>Can I spend bitcoin at regular stores?</summary>
                <div>
                  <p>Lightning adoption is growing, especially in regions where people feel the weight of inflation and
                    card processor fees. Any merchant running a <a href="accept-bitcoin-as-a-merchant.html">payment
                      processor</a> with Lightning support can accept your payment in seconds. Services like <a
                      href="/services/fold.html">Fold</a> offer bitcoin-back rewards on purchases at major retailers,
                    creating a bridge if your local shops do not accept bitcoin yet. The infrastructure is being built.
                    And unlike legacy payment rails, it does not need permission to expand.</p>

              <details>
                <summary>Do I need a separate wallet for Lightning and on-chain?</summary>
                <div>
                  <p>Not necessarily. Wallets like <a href="/services/muun.html">Muun</a> and <a
                      href="/services/aqua.html">Aqua</a> handle both on-chain and Lightning in one app. <a
                      href="/services/phoenix.html">Phoenix</a> focuses on Lightning but can receive on-chain
                    sends. For long-term savings, a common approach is to pair a Lightning wallet for everyday spending
                    with a separate <a href="store-it-safely.html">hardware wallet</a> or multisig setup for cold
                    storage. Think of it like a checking account and a vault. Different tools for different time
                    preferences.</p>
