        <h1>What is Bitcoin?</h1>
        <p>Bitcoin is an <strong>open, decentralized, and secure protocol for money</strong>. It allows anyone,
          anywhere, to store, send, and receive value without needing permission from a government, bank, or
          corporation. No company owns it. No board of directors controls it. It is a set of mathematical rules,
          enforced by a global network of participants and <strong>secured by energy</strong>.</p>
        <p>Every ten minutes, a new block of transactions is added to a shared ledger that anyone can read and verify.
          The rules are simple: there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin, transactions cannot be reversed once
          confirmed, and no single participant can change the protocol without the rest of the network agreeing. These
          rules are not enforced by a legal system. They are enforced by math and by the energy that miners spend to
          secure each block.</p>

        <blockquote class="pull-quote" aria-label="Quote by Jeff Booth">
          <p>Bitcoin is the most profound shift humanity has ever seen. It is more profound than any invention humanity
            has ever created.</p>
          <p>If it stays decentralized and secure then no matter what we do it is imposing new rules on the world. That
            means prices fall to the marginal costs of production and the free market is deflationary. You do not have
            to believe in that statement but it is happening to you anyways. So if you do not hold bitcoin, your prices
            are going up. If you denominate in bitcoin, all prices are going down. And they will forever.</p>
          <cite>Jeff Booth</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Why is Bitcoin Revolutionary?</h2>
        <p>Bitcoin combines two properties that have never existed together in the history of money:</p>
        <p><strong>Scarcity.</strong> There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. No government, no central bank, no
          corporation can create more. Every four years, the number of new bitcoin created per block is cut in half.
          This schedule is written into the code and enforced by every node on the network. By around the year 2140, the
          last bitcoin will be mined. That fixed supply makes bitcoin the hardest form of money ever created.</p>
        <p><strong>Decentralization.</strong> No single entity controls Bitcoin. Thousands of nodes around the world
          independently verify every transaction against the same set of rules. If someone tries to break the rules, for
          example by spending the same bitcoin twice, the network rejects the transaction. There is no CEO to lobby, no
          server to shut down, no headquarters to raid. Just math, code, and people who voluntarily run the software
          because it benefits them to do so.</p>
        <p>Together, these two properties create something that has never existed before: money you can trust, not
          because you trust someone, but because you do not have to.</p>

        <h2>How Does Bitcoin Benefit You?</h2>
        <p><strong>It protects your savings.</strong> Every year, central banks create more money. Every time they do,
          the money you already saved buys less. Bitcoin cannot be inflated. Its supply is fixed. Over time, as the
          economy produces more goods and services, and the amount of bitcoin stays the same, your purchasing power
          grows instead of shrinking.</p>
        <p><strong>You own it.</strong> When you hold bitcoin in your own wallet, no bank can freeze your account, no
          government can seize your funds, and no company can change the terms on you. You hold the keys. You control
          the money. That is a level of financial ownership that the traditional system does not offer.</p>
        <p><strong>You can send it to anyone.</strong> Bitcoin does not care about borders, business hours, or banking
          relationships. You can send value to anyone, anywhere in the world, at any time. The transaction settles on a
          global network that runs every minute of every day. No middlemen. No approval process. No waiting for
          clearance.</p>
        <p><strong>It is open to everyone.</strong> Billions of people around the world do not have access to a bank
          account. Bitcoin does not require one. All you need is an internet connection and a wallet. No credit check,
          no minimum balance, no paperwork. That makes bitcoin the most accessible form of money ever created.</p>

        <h2>What Are Satoshis?</h2>
        <p>You do not need to buy a whole bitcoin. Just like a dollar is divided into 100 cents, a bitcoin is divided
          into 100,000,000 satoshis (often shortened to "sats"). You can buy as little as a few sats at a time. One
          dollar worth of bitcoin today is thousands of satoshis.</p>
        <p>This matters because it means bitcoin is not just for large investors. You can start with any amount that
          fits your budget and build your position over time. Many people set up automatic purchases of a small, fixed
          amount each week. That approach removes the pressure of trying to pick the right moment and lets you
          accumulate steadily.</p>

        <h2>Why Not Just Use the Money We Have?</h2>
        <p>The money most people use today is created by central banks and commercial banks. It is not backed by
          anything physical. It is created when banks issue loans, and it disappears when those loans are repaid. The
          entire system runs on debt. If everyone paid back their debts, there would be no money left. That is not an
          exaggeration. That is how the system works.</p>
        <p>To keep this system from collapsing, central banks must create more money every year. That new money pushes
          prices up, which means your savings buy less. Over the past 50 years, the dollar has lost more than 85 percent
          of its purchasing power. Your wages may have gone up, but prices went up faster. The people who benefit from
          this system are the ones closest to the money creation: banks, large corporations, and governments. Everyone
          else falls behind.</p>
        <p>Bitcoin is the opposite. Its supply is fixed. No one can create more. In a world where technology makes
          everything cheaper and more efficient, a fixed supply of money means your purchasing power increases over time
          instead of decreasing. That is the natural state of a free market. Bitcoin restores it.</p>

        <h2>Is Bitcoin Safe?</h2>
        <p>The Bitcoin network has never been hacked. It is secured by proof-of-work, a mechanism that makes attacking
          the network prohibitively expensive. To alter a single transaction, an attacker would need to control more
          computing power than the entire rest of the network combined, and sustain that effort continuously. The energy
          cost makes it impractical.</p>
        <p>The risks in Bitcoin come not from the network itself, but from how you store your bitcoin. If you leave your
          bitcoin on an exchange, you are trusting that company to hold it for you. Exchanges can be hacked, go
          bankrupt, or freeze your account. Every major loss of user funds in Bitcoin's history, from Mt. Gox to FTX,
          happened because people trusted a third party with their keys.</p>
        <p>When you hold your own keys in your own wallet, you remove that risk. No one can access your bitcoin without
          your private key. That is what "not your keys, not your coins" means. If you hold the keys, you own bitcoin.
          If someone else holds the keys, you own a promise.</p>

        <h2>How Do You Get Started?</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Download a Bitcoin wallet.</strong><br>
            A wallet is the software that holds your private keys and lets you send and receive bitcoin. You can compare
            wallet options on Buoy to find one that fits your priorities.</li>
          <li><strong>Buy a small amount of bitcoin.</strong><br>
            You can purchase bitcoin from an exchange, a peer-to-peer platform, or earn it directly. Start with an
            amount you are comfortable with. You do not need to buy a full bitcoin.</li>
          <li><strong>Move it to your own wallet.</strong><br>
            Once you buy bitcoin, withdraw it from the exchange to your own wallet. This is the step that most beginners
            skip, and it is the most important one. Until you hold the keys, you do not hold bitcoin.</li>
          <li><strong>Learn at your own pace.</strong><br>
            Bitcoin rewards patience. You do not need to understand every technical detail before you start. Buy a small
            amount, move it to your wallet, and explore from there. Each step teaches you something the previous one
            could not.</li>
        </ol>
