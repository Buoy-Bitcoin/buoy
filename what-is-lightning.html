        <h1>What Is the Bitcoin Lightning Network?</h1>
        <p>The <strong>Lightning Network</strong> is a payment layer built on top of Bitcoin. It makes transactions
          fast, cheap, and scalable. Bitcoin's base layer settles about seven transactions per second. That is
          intentional. Keeping blocks small means anyone with a basic computer can run a node and verify the rules. But
          that design choice means on-chain Bitcoin is not practical for buying a coffee or tipping a content creator.
          Lightning solves that without compromising the security underneath.</p>
        <p>With Lightning, you can send bitcoin anywhere in the world in under a second, for a fraction of a cent. The
          payment travels through a network of payment channels and settles back to Bitcoin's base layer when those
          channels close. You get the speed of a credit card with the security of a protocol that no one controls.</p>

        <h2>How Lightning Works</h2>
        <p>Protocols scale in layers, not by making the base bigger. The internet works the same way. TCP/IP handles the
          foundation. HTTP handles web pages. Applications like email and video calls sit on top. Each layer does one
          thing well and does not compromise the others. Lightning follows this same principle. It handles instant,
          low-cost payments while anchoring back to Bitcoin's base layer for final settlement.</p>
        <p>Two people open a payment channel by locking bitcoin into a shared address on the blockchain. Once the
          channel is open, they can send payments back and forth as many times as they want without touching the
          blockchain at all. When they are done, they close the channel, and the final balance settles on-chain. One
          on-chain transaction to open, one to close, and unlimited payments in between.</p>
        <p>You do not need a direct channel with every person you pay. Lightning routes payments through a network of
          connected channels, finding a path from sender to receiver in milliseconds. The result is a system that can
          handle millions of transactions per second without adding any load to Bitcoin's base layer.</p>

        <h2>Why Lightning Matters</h2>
        <p>Without Lightning, a Bitcoin transaction can take 10 minutes or more to confirm and carry fees above one
          dollar. That is fine for large transfers or final settlement, but it does not work for everyday payments.
          Lightning changes the math entirely.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Payments confirm in less than a second. Faster than tapping a credit card.</li>
          <li><strong>Low fees:</strong> Sending a few cents costs a fraction of a cent. Microtransactions become
            practical for the first time.</li>
          <li><strong>Scale:</strong> Millions of transactions per second, off-chain, without congesting the base layer.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Lightning payments do not appear on the public blockchain. Only the opening and
            closing of channels are recorded on-chain, which gives everyday transactions more privacy than on-chain
            transfers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sending Money Across Borders</h2>
        <p>Sending money to another country through the traditional system means dealing with intermediaries. Banks,
          Western Union, currency exchanges. Each one takes a fee. Each one adds delay. A transfer can take days and
          cost 5 to 10 percent of the amount you send. For someone sending money home to their family, that is a real
          loss.</p>
        <p>Lightning removes every intermediary. You send sats (small units of bitcoin) directly from your wallet to the
          recipient. It arrives in under a second. It costs almost nothing. No paperwork. No currency conversion. No
          waiting period. Both the sender and the receiver keep more of their money because no one sits in the middle
          taking a cut.</p>

        <h2>What Is a Lightning Address?</h2>
        <p>A <strong>Lightning Address</strong> makes sending bitcoin as simple as sending an email. Instead of copying
          long wallet codes or scanning QR codes, you type a human-readable address that looks like this:</p>
        <p><code>yourname@yourdomain.com</code></p>
        <p>You enter the address in your wallet, type the amount, and hit send. The payment arrives in under a second.
          Some wallets and services let you create your own Lightning Address, which means anyone who knows it can send
          you bitcoin without needing to coordinate invoices or share public keys.</p>

        <h2>Custody Matters on Lightning Too</h2>
        <p>Not all Lightning wallets work the same way. Some are custodial, which means a company manages the payment
          channels and holds the keys on your behalf. That is easier to set up, but it reintroduces the same trust you
          are trying to avoid. If the company fails, restricts withdrawals, or gets hacked, your funds are at risk.</p>
        <p>Non-custodial Lightning wallets let you control your own channels and your own keys. They require more setup,
          but they preserve the properties that make Bitcoin valuable in the first place: no counterparty risk, no
          permission needed, no trusted intermediary.</p>
        <p>If you are new to Lightning, starting with a custodial wallet is a reasonable first step. But plan your move
          to a non-custodial option as you learn. That is the difference between using Bitcoin and using a promise that
          looks like Bitcoin.</p>

        <h2>How to Get Started</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Download a Lightning wallet.</strong><br>
            Choose a wallet that supports Lightning payments. You can compare several options <a
              href="spend-bitcoin.html">here</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Fund it with bitcoin.</strong><br>
            Buy bitcoin from an exchange or receive it from someone else, then send it to your Lightning wallet.</li>
          <li><strong>Create or link a Lightning Address.</strong><br>
            Some wallets and services let you create a Lightning Address so others can send you bitcoin using a simple,
            memorable format.</li>
          <li><strong>Start sending and receiving.</strong><br>
            Try sending a few sats to a friend or a content creator. See how fast it arrives and how little it costs.
            That experience makes the technology real in a way that reading about it never does.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>Bitcoin is the foundation. It is the hardest money ever created, secured by energy and enforced by math. But
          for bitcoin to work as everyday money, not just a store of value, it needs a payment layer that matches the
          speed people expect. Lightning is that layer.</p>
        <p>Every time someone pays for a coffee with Lightning, tips a creator with sats, or sends money across a border
          in under a second, Bitcoin becomes more useful to more people. And every Lightning payment is still bitcoin.
          Not a token, not a copy. Actual bitcoin moving through payment channels that settle on the same base layer
          that protects the entire network.</p>
        <p>You can start using Lightning today. Pick a wallet, fund it, and send your first payment. The future of money
          is not something you wait for. It is something you can choose to use right now.</p>
